## About

Oswald is a reworking of the classic gothic typeface style historically represented by designs such as 'Alternate Gothic'. The characters of Oswald have been re-drawn and reformed to better fit the pixel grid of standard digital screens. Oswald is designed to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

- `make build` will produce font files.
- `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
- `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at `https://alexeiva.github.io/OswaldFont`.
